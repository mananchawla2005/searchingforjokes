Dating a journalist when you have a secret identity? Nightmare fuel. Lois is\u2026a lot. She\u2019ll be like, \u201cClark, you saved a cat from a tree *again*? That's not a crisis, that's a Tuesday!\u201d And he\u2019s all, \u201cBut\u2026it was a very fluffy cat!\u201d (Delivers with genuine sincerity).

He's basically immortal, right? So they've been trying to find a replacement for decades. They tried a guy with super-strength, but no sense of direction.

You're doing fine.\u201d\n\n(Shrugs)\n\nHe sighs. \u201cBut what if the next meteor is\u2026lukewarm?\u201d\n\n\n\n(Beat, looks directly at the audience)\n\nHonestly, I think he needs a vacation.

Seriously, the dental is *terrible*.\n\nMy last performance review? It was\u2026 awkward. My boss, this guy named Bob, just kept saying, 'Look, the planet's still here. Good job.' Like, that's it? No constructive criticism? He did dock me points for 'excessive use of company property' because I used heat vision to make s'mores at the office picnic.\n\nBut the *real* killer? The constant holding back. It's exhausting. Imagine having the power to solve world hunger, but you're told, 'No, no, gotta let them figure it out. Free will and all that.' It's like being a super-powered mime. All this potential, and I'm just\u2026 silently judging everyone's life choices. (Does a tiny, frustrated mime gesture, holds it a beat longer) I've started taking improv classes. It's the only place I can *legally* express myself without accidentally leveling a city.\n\nAnd then there's the Kryptonite thing. Everyone thinks it's a weakness, right? It's not. It's\u2026 a boundary issue. Seriously. Lex Luthor doesn't *want* to hurt me. He wants to be the one who gets to hold the green rock. It's a power dynamic. He's like, 'Oh, you're feeling strong today, Superman? Let me just\u2026 *adjust* that.' (Mimics Luthor adjusting a dial) My therapist says I attract emotionally unavailable villains.\n\nAnd don't even get me started on the succession plan. I'm basically immortal.

What happens when he *eventually* decides to retire (or just needs a vacation)?**\u201d \u2013 how hard could it be? Turns out, *very* hard.\n\nOne kid, bless his heart, developed the ability to control pigeons. Just\u2026 pigeons. He spent three days trying to stop a bank robbery with a flock of birds. It was\u2026 messy. Then there was the one who could only fly sideways. *Sideways!* He kept crashing into buildings. We had to issue him a helmet. And a very large apology to the city of Metropolis. Honestly, at this point, I'm thinking of just training a really smart dog.\n\nSo yeah, saving the world. It's on my resume. But sometimes, I look at all these problems, and I think\u2026 maybe humanity *deserves* a little bit of catastrophe. Just to spice things up. Don't tell Bob in HR.

Apparently, \u2018saving the day\u2019 can be perceived as \u2018mansplaining global crises.\u2019\u201d \n\n(Beat)\n\nIt\u2019s like, he\u2019s the ultimate overqualified employee; **\u201csaving the world is probably listed as \u2018other duties as assigned\u2019 on his performance review.\u201d** I picture him trying to book a week off, and the system just says, \u201cError: Global instability detected. Request denied.\u201d Like, does he even *get* vacation time?\n\n(Slightly exasperated)\n\nAnd it's not just the workload. It's the emotional labor. It\u2019s like being at a kid's birthday party and knowing you could stop a rogue bouncy castle from flying into traffic, but you just\u2026stand there. You just politely clap. That's a special kind of torture. I struggle to hold back from commenting on people's questionable life choices, honestly. It\u2019s like being a super-powered mime \u2013 **\u201cthe emotional toll of constantly having to *hold back* \u2013 like being a super-powered mime.\u201d**\n\n(Beat, shifts tone slightly)\n\nBut then there's the whole Kryptonite thing\u2026 which, let\u2019s be real, is a relationship issue. Lois Lane is *clearly* the one who keeps accidentally leaving Kryptonite around. It's passive-aggressive, honestly. Like, \u201cOh, I just found this interesting rock. It really brings out your eyes\u2026and weakens your superpowers.\u201d She\u2019s probably got a whole collection. \u201cThis one\u2019s for when you forget to take out the trash. This one\u2019s for when you don\u2019t compliment my reporting.\u201d\n\n(Pause for laughter)\n\nBut the biggest question\u2026 who replaces him? They're not looking for someone with superpowers. They're looking for someone with *insurance*. **\u201cSuperman is functionally immortal (solar energy, etc.). What happens when he *eventually* decides to retire (or just needs a vacation)? Is there a Superman Academy? Is there a rigorous vetting process?\u201d** No, they\u2019re looking for someone who won\u2019t bankrupt the planet with medical bills.\n\n(Beat, delivers final line with a sigh)\n\nThe job posting is just a list of disclaimers. \u201cBenefits include: Frequent alien encounters, existential dread, and a cape that gets caught in revolving doors.\u201d Honestly? I think he\u2019ll just keep showing up. Someone has to.\n\n\n\n",

Like you\u2019re showing up to build a birdhouse with a degree in astrophysics? And that got me thinking about Superman\u2026\n\n(Pause for recognition)\n\nHe\u2019s the ultimate overqualified employee. Seriously. \u201cStrengths: Intergalactic threat neutralization. Areas for Improvement: Needs to delegate more. Keeps taking on all the asteroid deflection himself.\u201d I mean, *I* get a free bagel on my birthday. He\u2019s saving planets!\n\nBut let's be real, the *real* superpower isn't flying. It's\u2026 logistics. **\u201cThe sheer logistical nightmare of maintaining a secret identity in the 21st century.\u201d** Like, how does Clark Kent explain all the missed work? \u201cOh, just a really bad case of\u2026 space allergies?\u201d And the social media! He has to have *two* separate phone plans. Two Instagram accounts. It's exhausting! Imagine the data usage. I bet he's constantly deleting location data. \u201cNo, I wasn't near that exploding volcano, Brenda!\u201d\n\n(Slightly exasperated)\n\nBut it's not just the tech, it's the *emotional* weight of it all. **\u201cThe emotional toll of constantly having to *hold back* \u2013 like being a super-powered mime.\u201d** Imagine waiting in line at the DMV. Someone cuts you. You have the power to gently *relocate* them to another state\u2026 but you can\u2019t. You just\u2026 sigh. And fill out form 27B/6. It's gotta be exhausting! Like, \"I could solve world hunger, but Karen is arguing about a coupon.\"\n\n(Shifts tone, more cynical)\n\nAnd Kryptonite? Everyone thinks it's just a weakness, right? No. It's\u2026 complicated. Lois is just *done*. She's like, \u201cIt's always *something* with you, Clark. First it's the cape, now it's the green rocks?\u201d I bet she hides the Kryptonite in the cookie jar. \u201cJust a little something to keep you grounded.\u201d \n\n(Beat)\n\nHonestly, I think Lois is planning for the inevitable. She\u2019s already scouting potential replacements. I overheard her telling Martha Kent, \u201cHe needs someone who can handle the pressure\u2026 and doesn't leave their cape in the washing machine.\u201d I think she's grooming Supergirl. It's a whole *thing*.\n\n(Slight pause, shrugs)\n\nHonestly, I think he just wants to be a mild-mannered accountant. No capes, no villains, just\u2026 spreadsheets. But then Lois finds out and says, \u201cAbsolutely not. You have a brand to maintain.\u201d\n\n\n\n(Beat, looks directly at the audience)\n\nHe\u2019s saving the world, and she\u2019s worried about his *brand*. That\u2019s a marriage, folks. That\u2019s a marriage.\n\n\n\n",

More\u2026 *accountable!*\u201d Honestly, it\u2019s like dating my mother. \n\n(Beat)\n\nHonestly, I\u2019m starting to think I need a restraining order. And a therapist. A *really* good therapist.\n\n(Paces slightly)\n\nAnd the succession planning? Don\u2019t even get me started. I asked for a sabbatical. A *week* off. They started a global search for my replacement. Like I\u2019m easily replaceable! As the analysts pointed out, **\u201cSuperman is functionally immortal (solar energy, etc.). What happens when he *eventually* decides to retire (or just needs a vacation)?\u201d** The Academy was a disaster. They wanted someone \u2018with vision.\u2019 One applicant\u2019s vision was exclusively focused on building a giant robot dinosaur. Another kept trying to fly through walls. It was\u2026 a learning experience. \n\n(Shakes head)\n\nThe interview questions are insane. \u2018On a scale of one to ten, how comfortable are you with public scrutiny?\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m a superhero.
